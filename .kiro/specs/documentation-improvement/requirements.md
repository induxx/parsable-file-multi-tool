# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to improve the existing documentation structure to make it more consistent, professional, and production-ready. The current documentation lacks consistency in formatting, structure, and completeness, making it difficult for users to effectively understand and use the parsable-file-multi-tool project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the parsable-file-multi-tool, I want comprehensive and well-structured documentation, so that I can quickly understand how to use the tool and its various components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a clear project overview with purpose and key features
2. WHEN a user navigates the documentation THEN the system SHALL present consistent formatting and structure across all pages
3. WHEN a user looks for specific functionality THEN the system SHALL provide organized sections with clear navigation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new user of the parsable-file-multi-tool, I want clear getting started documentation, so that I can quickly set up and begin using the tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user accesses the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step installation instructions
2. WHEN a user needs to configure the tool THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive configuration examples
3. WHEN a user wants to run their first transformation THEN the system SHALL provide a quick start guide with working examples

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with transformations, I want detailed action and directive documentation, so that I can understand all available options and their usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs to use an action THEN the system SHALL provide complete documentation including syntax, parameters, and examples
2. WHEN a user wants to understand directives THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations with practical use cases
3. WHEN a user encounters an action or directive THEN the system SHALL provide consistent documentation format across all components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user troubleshooting issues, I want comprehensive error handling and debugging documentation, so that I can resolve problems efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guides with common solutions
2. WHEN a user needs to debug transformations THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging instructions and options
3. WHEN a user faces performance issues THEN the system SHALL provide optimization guidelines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer extending the tool, I want technical architecture documentation, so that I can understand the codebase and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer wants to extend functionality THEN the system SHALL provide architecture overview and component relationships
2. WHEN a developer needs to create custom actions THEN the system SHALL provide extension development guidelines
3. WHEN a developer wants to contribute THEN the system SHALL provide development setup and contribution guidelines

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user of the documentation, I want consistent formatting and navigation, so that I can efficiently find and consume information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates between documentation pages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent header structure and formatting
2. WHEN a user looks for code examples THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted and syntax-highlighted code blocks
3. WHEN a user needs cross-references THEN the system SHALL provide working internal links and clear navigation paths
