- Inconsistent parameter table formatting across actions
- Variable use of "Last updated" dates and metadata

**Directive Documentation Variations:**
- Different approaches to parameter documentation
- Some files missing "Common Issues and Solutions" sections
- Inconsistent cross-reference formatting

#### 2. Content Completeness Gaps

**Missing Examples:**
- Several actions reference examples that don't exist in the examples directory
- Some complex scenarios mentioned but not demonstrated
- Limited real-world integration examples

**Incomplete Cross-References:**
- Some internal links point to non-existent sections
- Missing bidirectional references between related topics
- Inconsistent linking patterns

#### 3. Technical Accuracy Concerns

**Code Examples:**
- Some YAML examples may have syntax issues (need validation)
- File paths in examples may not match actual directory structure
- Version-specific features not clearly marked

**Parameter Documentation:**
- Some parameter descriptions lack sufficient detail
- Missing information about parameter interactions
- Incomplete coverage of edge cases and limitations
