# copy tool

We don't have a official copy tool, it's not really needed actually.
It's better to connect reader and writer to each other and do functional stuff in between.
Different combo's are possible and the code remains human readable

## examples

Here we make a copy of the same file
```php

$parser = CsvParser::create(__DIR__ . '/family.csv');
$csvWriter = new CsvWriter(__DIR__ . '/family_copy.csv');

$parser->loop(function ($row) use ($csvWriter) {
    $csvWriter->write($row);
});
```

Here we make a copy of the file but save it in xml

```php

$parser = CsvParser::create(__DIR__ . '/family.csv');
$xmlWriter = new XmlWriter(__DIR__ . '/family_copy.xml');

$parser->loop(function ($row) use ($xmlWriter) {
    $xmlWriter->write($row);
});
```

Here we make a copy of a section of the family csv

```php

$parser = CsvParser::create(__DIR__ . '/family.csv');
$reader = new Reader($parser);
$csvWriter = new CsvWriter(__DIR__ . '/family_led_tvs.csv');

$reader
  ->find(['family' => 'led_tvs', 'display_diagonal' => '26'])
  ->loop(function ($row) use ($csvWriter) {
    $csvWriter->write($row);
});
```
